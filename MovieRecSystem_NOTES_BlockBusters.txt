    Navigation Bar updates (Front-end)
        Link to subpages (use Route)
            Currently, Movie & TV Show leads to Movie page
            Home and Login goes to login page
    
    Log in (Front-end) added
        could type in username and password

    Issues
        Fix Button Issues
        Login Page is weird. Needs to fill entire page. 
        Navigation Bar needs to be better stylized 

        Inner Pages Needed (anything you click that doesn't go anywhere)

    Login Page 
        link up with firebase authentication seems to be working.
        Issues
            Could have header to distinguish when we are in Sign-in or Sign up
            Need to fix logout. 
                When you log in, it should take you to movie page, I didn't get it working. 
                I also have to figure out how to configure navbar logout when clicked on to login-page.
